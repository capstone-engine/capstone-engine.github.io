We are excited to announce the stable version **3.0.3** of Capstone disassembly framework!

This release is dedicated to *Prof. Yoshiyasu Takefuji*, who is turning 60 years old this year 2015!

The source code is available in [zip](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0.3.zip) and [tar.gz](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0.3.tar.gz) formats, or at tagname [3.0.3](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/releases/tag/3.0.3) in our Github repo.

Find pre-compiled binaries in the [Download section](http://capstone-engine.org/download.html).

For any issues, please feed back via our [contact](contact.html).

**NOTE**

- Do use the Python bindings come with this version, as we fixed some issues of version *3.0.2*.

  See file *bindings/python/README* in the source on how to do fresh-install.

- Our Python package [capstone](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/capstone) on *PyPi* can build & install the *core* at the time of installing Python module,
  so the external dependency on the core is eliminated.
  
  Windows users can either instal Python binding of Capstone from [Windows installer](http://capstone-engine.org/download.html), or using our PyPi package [capstone-windows](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/capstone-windows). Note that this already includes the *prebuilt* libraries (for both *Win32* & *Win64* editions) inside, so there is no need to install the core separately.
  
  See [bindings/python/README.TXT](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/master/bindings/python/README.TXT) for more information on these PyPi modules.

Summary of the important changes of version 3.0.3.

#### Library

- Released binaries for Windows are now compatible with Windows XP.
- Support to embed into Mac OS X kernel extensions.
- Now it is possible to compile Capstone with older C compilers, such as *GCC 4.8* on Ubuntu 12.04.
- Add *test_iter* to MSVC project.

#### X86

- All shifted instructions (*SHL*, *SHR*, *SAL*, *SAR*, *RCL*, *RCR*, *ROL* & *ROR*) now support $1 as first operand in *AT&T* syntax (so we have *rcll $1, %edx* instead of *rcll %edx*).
- *CMPXCHG16B* is a valid instruction with *LOCK* prefix.
- Fixed a segfault on the input of *0xF3*.

#### Arm

- *BLX* instruction modifies *PC* & *LR* registers.

#### Sparc

- Improved displacement decoding for sparc banching instructions.

#### Python binding

- Fix for Cython so it can properly initialize.
- *X86Op.avx_zero_mask* now has *c_bool* type, but not *c_uint8* type.
- Properly support compile with *Cygwin* & install binding (*setup.py*).
