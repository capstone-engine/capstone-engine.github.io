We are happy to announce the stable version **2.1.2** of Capstone disassembly framework!

This fixes some bugs deep inside the core. There is no update to the API interface, so bindings of older version 2.1 are compatible, thus can still be used with this release.

Find the source code & precompiled binaries in the [download](download.html) section. See [documentation](documentation.html) for how to compile and install Capstone.

Highlights of the changes:

- Support cross-compilation for all iDevices (iPhone/iPad/iPod).

- X86: do not print memory offset in negative form.

- Fix a bug in X86 when Capstone cannot handle short instruction.

- Print negative numbers in range \[-9, -1\] without prefix 0x (arm64, mips, arm).

- Correct the SONAME setup for library versioning on Linux, \*BSD & Solaris.

- Set library versioning for dylib of OSX.

- Remove the redundant *include/diet.h*

**NOTE**

- This release fixes the library versioning for Mac OSX, Linux, \*BSD & Solaris. This might require recompiling tools compiled with prior Capstone - but there is no need to modify tools' source whatsoever.

- This version made no API change, so old bindings of release 2.1 still work just fine. The only exception is Python binding package for Windows in [Download](download.html) section: users still need to upgrade this as this package actually includes the new core engine 2.1.2 inside.
