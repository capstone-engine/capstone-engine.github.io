Release 2.1.1 is a bugfix version which fixes some security & stable issues.

<br>

#### Core changes

- Fix a buffer overflow bug in Thumb mode (ARM). For this reason, all ARM users should upgrade.

- Fix a crash issue when embedding Capstone into Mac OSX kernel by reducing the stack memory usage. This should also enable Capstone to be embedded into other systems with limited stack memory size such as Linux kernel or some firmwares.

- Use a proper SONAME for library versioning (Linux).

#### NOTE

- This version made no API change, so old bindings of release 2.1 still work just fine. The only exception is Python binding package for Windows in [Download](download.html) section: users still need to upgrade this since this package actually includes the new core engine 2.1.1 inside.
