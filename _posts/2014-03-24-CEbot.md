We running a **CEbot**, a tool help you disassemble binary code right from your Twitter account.

To use *CEbot*, follow these 2 simple steps:

- *Tweet* your hex string with hashtag **#2ce** ("**To-C**apstone-**E**ngine"), or send it directly to **@ceb0t**.

- Wait 1 ~ 2 seconds, the reversed assembly code will be sent back, also via Twitter. Be sure to check the *Notifications* tab if you do not see it soon enough.
