Release 3.0.2 is a stable version with important fixes in the core & Python bindings.

<br>


#### Library

- On *nix, only export symbols that are part of the API (instead of all
  the internal symbols).


#### X86

- Do not consider *0xF2* as *REPNE* prefix if it is a part of instruction encoding.
- Fix implicit registers read/written & instruction groups of some instructions.
- More flexible on the order of prefixes, so better handle some tricky
  instructions.
- *REPNE* prefix can go with *STOS* & *MOVS* instructions.
- Fix a compilation bug for *X86_REDUCE* mode.
- Fix operand size of instructions with operand *PTR []*.


#### Arm

- Fix a bug where arm_op_mem.disp is wrongly calculated (in DETAIL mode).
- Fix a bug on handling the If-Then block.


#### Mips

- Sanity check for the input size for MIPS64 mode.


#### MSVC

- Compile capstone.dll with static runtime MSVCR built in.


#### Python binding

- Fix a compiling issue of Cython binding with gcc *4.9*.
