We are happy to announce a little web-based tool named **CEnigma** to disassemble input hexcode!

*CEnigma* offers some advantages:

- Fast, simple & easy to use: just paste your hexstring, choose architecture/mode/syntax, then submit to get back assembly code.

- User-friendly: accept input of all kind of formats (as long as it contains hexcode inside).

- Provide instruction details (just hover the mouse over the assembly instructions).

- Link to assembly manual (just click into the assembly instructions).

- Save output for future references (choose *Duration* before submitting).

- Backed by *Capstone*, *CEnigma* is always updated on all 8 architectures: Arm, Arm64, Mips, PPC, Sparc, SystemZ, XCore, X86 (+X86_64).
