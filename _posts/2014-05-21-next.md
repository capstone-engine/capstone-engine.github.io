We have been working hard for the next release of Capstone, which promises a lot of important updates in various areas.

Get the latest code from our Github's [next branch](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/tree/next) to experience the cutting-edge features of the upcoming version.

Summary of the most interesting changes:

- New architectures: *Sparc* & *SystemZ*.

- Important bugfixes for *Arm*, *Arm64*, *Mips* & *X86*.

- Handle *3DNow* instructions of X86.

- Support for [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/COMPILE_MSVC.TXT) (so Windows native compilation using *MSVC* is possible).

- Cross-compile for *Android*.

- Support [SKIPDATA mode](http://capstone-engine.org/skipdata.html), so Capstone can jump over unknown data and keep going at the next legitimate instruction.

- Python binding supports *Python3*.

- *X86* engine is now mature & handle all the *malware tricks* that we are aware of. If you have any code that Capstone wrongly processes, please [report](contact.html) so we can fix them.


Further details are available in our [Changelog](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/wiki/ChangeLog)

On a related news, Capstone now has [NodeJS binding](https://github.com/parasyte/node-capstone)! This great work was created & maintained by *Jason Oster*.
