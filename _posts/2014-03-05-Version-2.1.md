We are happy to announce version **2.1** of Capstone disassembly framework!

The source code & precompiled binaries are in the [download](download.html) section. See [documentation](documentation.html) for how to compile and install Capstone.

Highlights of some important changes:

- Library size is around 40% smaller, but framework is faster. Especially, X86-only binary is about 3 times smaller than in version 2.0: only *780 KB* now.

- Support [diet compilation](diet.html) option to minimize the framework, making Capstone more suitable for embedding into OS kernel or firmware. Example: X86-only engine is only *480 KB* with this customization.

- Consume less memory: around 40% less than version 2.0.

- Python binding offers some new lighter APIs that can improve performance up to 30%.

- Fixed some memory leaking issues of Java & Cython bindings.

- Lots of bugfixes.

- API version bumped to 2.1.

- See [changelog](http://capstone-engine.org/Version-2.1-changelog.html) for more details.

**NOTE**

- This version made an **API change**, so some (trivial) modifications to 2.0-based tools are needed to [switch to 2.1](version_2.1_API.html).

- Make sure to install the Python/Java bindings coming with this version, as the old bindings from version 2.0 are incompatible with the new core.
