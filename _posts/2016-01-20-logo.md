We are very excited to announce a [new logo](/img/capstone.png) for Capstone engine! This shiny logo better reflects the spirit of our project, and is more suitable for Tshirts, stickers, mugs etc.

We would like to thank [Xipiter](http://www.xipiter.com) for sponsoring the redesign of our new logo! The [generous & continuous supports](/donate.html) from community like this is the main reason why we keep putting significant time and effort maintaining & developing Capstone!

At the same time, we redesigned the website, so it is more friendly with mobile devices (such as smartphones & tablets). Let us know if you find any broken links.
