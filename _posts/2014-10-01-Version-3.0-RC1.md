We are pleased to announce the **Release Candidate 1** of version **3.0** of Capstone disassembly framework!

The source code is available in [zip](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0-rc1.zip) and [tar.gz](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0-rc1.tar.gz) formats, or at tagname [3.0-rc1](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/releases/tag/3.0-rc1) in our Github repo.

Please test and feed back via our [contact](contact.html).

**NOTE**

- Do use the bindings come with this version, as all the old bindings from version *2.x* are *incompatible and cannot be run with the 3.0 core*.

  For Java/Ocaml/Python bindings, see respective *README* files under *bindings/* directory in the source on how to do fresh-install.

Summary of the important changes of version 3.0-RC1 (see [Changelog](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/wiki/ChangeLog) for more details):

- New architectures: *Sparc*, *SystemZ* & *XCore*.

- Important bugfixes for *Arm*, *Arm64*, *Mips*, *PowerPC* & *X86*.

- *X86* engine now can decode *3DNow* instructions.

- *X86* engine is mature & handles all the *malware tricks* that we are aware of. If you have any code that Capstone wrongly processes, please [report](contact.html).

- *Mips* engine added supports for new hardware modes: *Mips3*, *Mips32R6* & *MipsGP64*.

- Support for [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/COMPILE_MSVC.TXT) (so Windows native compilation using *MSVC* is possible).

- Support [CMake compilation](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/COMPILE_CMAKE.TXT).

- Cross-compile for *Android*.

- Much faster, while consuming less memory for all architectures.

- API version was bumped to *3.0*.

- Renamed API *cs_disasm_ex* to *cs_disasm* (*cs_disasm_ex* is marked obsolete to be removed in future versions)

- Support [SKIPDATA mode](http://capstone-engine.org/skipdata.html), so Capstone can jump over unknown data and keep going from the next legitimate instruction.

- Python binding supports *Python3*.

- Support [Ocaml binding](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/bindings/ocaml/README).
