Release 3.0.3 is a stable version with important fixes in the core & Python bindings.

<br>


#### Library

- Released binaries for Windows are now compatible with Windows XP.
- Support to embed into Mac OS X kernel extensions.
- Now it is possible to compile Capstone with older C compilers, such as *GCC 4.8* on Ubuntu 12.04.
- Add *test_iter* to MSVC project.

#### X86

- All shifted instructions (*SHL*, *SHR*, *SAL*, *SAR*, *RCL*, *RCR*, *ROL* & *ROR*) now support $1 as first operand in *AT&T* syntax (so we have *rcll $1, %edx* instead of *rcll %edx*).
- *CMPXCHG16B* is a valid instruction with *LOCK* prefix.
- Fixed a segfault on the input of *0xF3*.

#### Arm

- *BLX* instruction modifies *PC* & *LR* registers.

#### Sparc

- Improved displacement decoding for sparc banching instructions.

#### Python binding

- Fix for Cython so it can properly initialize.
- *X86Op.avx_zero_mask* now has *c_bool* type, but not *c_uint8* type.
- Properly support compile with *Cygwin* & install binding (*setup.py*).
