We are very happy to announce version **5.0** of Capstone disassembler framework!

This release fixes a lot of bugs and adds few new architectures. We strongly encourage all users of v4 to upgrade.

We wish to express our sincere gratitude to all [contributors](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/graphs/contributors) & [donators](donate), who generously supported us to maintain Capstone!

The source code is available in [zip](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/archive/refs/tags/5.0.zip) & [tar.gz](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/archive/refs/tags/5.0.tar.gz) formats, or at tag-name [5.0](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/releases/tag/5.0) in our Github repo.

We are planning for the next major release, version *6.0*. Stay tuned for updates!
