We are excited to announce version **3.0** of Capstone disassembly framework!

The source code is available in [zip](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0.zip) and [tar.gz](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0.tar.gz) formats, or at tagname [3.0](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/releases/tag/3.0) in our Github repo.

Find pre-compiled binaries in the [Download section](http://capstone-engine.org/download.html).

Please test and feed back via our [contact](contact.html).

**NOTE**

- Do use the bindings come with this version, as all the old bindings from previous version *3.0-rcX* or *2.x* are *incompatible and cannot be run* with the *3.0* core.

  For Java/Ocaml/Python bindings, see the respective *README* files under *bindings/* directory in the source on how to do fresh-reinstall.

Summary of the important changes since *2.1.2* ([more detail](http://capstone-engine.org/Version-3.0-changelog.html)):

- *API*
  - New API *cs_disasm_iter* & *cs_malloc* (See [online doc](http://capstone-engine.org/iteration.html)).
  - Renamed API *cs_disasm_ex* to *cs_disasm* (*cs_disasm_ex* is still supported, but marked *deprecated* to be removed in future)
  - Support [SKIPDATA mode](http://capstone-engine.org/skipdata.html), so Capstone can jump over unknown data and keep going from the next legitimate instruction.
  - API version was bumped to *3.0*.

- *Bindings support*
  - Python binding supports *Python 3* (besides Python 2).
  - Support [Ocaml binding](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/bindings/ocaml/README).

- *Architectures*
  - New architectures: *Sparc*, *SystemZ* & *XCore*.
  - Support new instructions & have important bugfixes for *Arm*, *Arm64*, *Mips*, *PowerPC* & *X86*.
  - Always expose absolute addresses rather than relative addresses (*Arm*, *Arm64*, *Mips*, *PPC*, *Sparc*, *X86*).

  - *X86*: more mature & handles all the *malware tricks* (that we are aware of).

  - *ARM*: Support new mode *CS_MODE_V8* for *Armv8 A32* encodings.

  - *Mips*
    - Supports new hardware modes: *Mips32R6* (*CS_MODE_MIPS32R6) & *MipsGP64* (*CS_MODE_MIPSGP64*).
    - Removed the ABI-only mode *CS_MODE_N64*.
    - New modes *CS_MODE_MIPS32* & *CS_MODE_MIPS64* (instead of *CS_MODE_32* & *CS_MODE_64*).

- Support [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/COMPILE_MSVC.TXT) (so Windows native compilation using *MSVC* is possible).

- Support [CMake compilation](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/COMPILE_CMAKE.TXT).

- Cross-compile for *Android*.

- Build libraries/tests using [XCode project](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/xcode/README.md)

- Much faster, while consuming less memory for all architectures.
