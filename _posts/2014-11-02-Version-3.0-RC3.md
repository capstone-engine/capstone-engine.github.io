We are happy to announce the **Release Candidate 3** of version **3.0** of Capstone disassembly framework!

The source code is available in [zip](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0-rc3.zip) and [tar.gz](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0-rc3.tar.gz) formats, or at tagname [3.0-rc3](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/releases/tag/3.0-rc3) in our Github repo.

**NOTE**

- Do use the bindings come with this version, as all the old bindings from previous version *3.0-RC2* or *2.x* are *incompatible and cannot be run with the *3.0-RC3* core*.

  For Java/Ocaml/Python bindings, see the respective *README* files under *bindings/* directory in the source on how to do fresh-reinstall.
