We are glad to announce a stable version **2.1.1** of Capstone disassembly framework!

This is a *stable release* to fix some bugs deep in the core. There is no new update to any architectures or bindings, so programs written with version 2.1 still work without having to recompile. Besides, bindings of older version 2.1 are compatible, thus can still be used this release.

The source code & precompiled binaries are in the [download](download.html) section. See [documentation](documentation.html) for how to compile and install Capstone.

Highlights of the changes:

- Fix a buffer overflow bug in Thumb mode (ARM). For this reason, all ARM users should upgrade.

- Fix a crash issue when embedding Capstone into Mac OSX kernel by reducing the stack memory usage. This should also enable Capstone to be embedded into other systems with limited stack memory size such as Linux kernel or some firmwares.

- Use a proper SONAME for library versioning (Linux).

- See [changelog](http://capstone-engine.org/Version-2.1.1-changelog.html) for more details.

**NOTE**

- This version made no API change, so old bindings of release 2.1 still work just fine. The only exception is Python binding package for Windows in [Download](download.html) section: users still need to upgrade this as this package actually includes the new core engine 2.1.1 inside.
