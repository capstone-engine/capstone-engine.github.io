We are happy to announce the stable version *3.0.2* of Capstone disassembly framework!

The source code is available in [zip](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0.2.zip) and [tar.gz](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0.2.tar.gz) formats, or at tagname [3.0.2](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/releases/tag/3.0.2) in our Github repo.

Find pre-compiled binaries in the [Download section](http://capstone-engine.org/download.html).

Please test and feed back via our [contact](contact.html).

*NOTE*:

- Our Python package [capstone](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/capstone) on *PyPi* can build & install the *core* at the time of installing Python module,
  so the external dependency on the core is eliminated.
  
  Windows users can either instal Python binding of Capstone from [Windows installer](http://capstone-engine.org/download.html), or using our PyPi package [capstone-windows](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/capstone-windows). Note that this already includes the *prebuilt* libraries (for both *Win32* & *Win64* editions) inside, so there is no need to install the core separately.
  
  See [bindings/python/README.TXT](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/master/bindings/python/README.TXT) for more information on these PyPi modules.

Summary of the important changes of this version.

- **Library**

  - On *nix, only export symbols that are part of the API (instead of all
  the internal symbols).


- **X86**

  - Do not consider *0xF2* as *REPNE* prefix if it is a part of instruction encoding.
  - Fix implicit registers read/written & instruction groups of some instructions.
  - More flexible on the order of prefixes, so better handle some tricky
    instructions.
  - *REPNE* prefix can go with *STOS* & *MOVS* instructions.
  - Fix a compilation bug for *X86_REDUCE* mode.
  - Fix operand size of instructions with operand *PTR []*.


- **Arm**

  - Fix a bug where arm_op_mem.disp is wrongly calculated (in DETAIL mode).
  - Fix a bug on handling the If-Then block.


- **Mips**

  - Sanity check for the input size for MIPS64 mode.


- **MSVC**

  - Compile capstone.dll with static runtime MSVCR built in.


- **Python binding**

  - Fix a compiling issue of Cython binding with *gcc 4.9*.
