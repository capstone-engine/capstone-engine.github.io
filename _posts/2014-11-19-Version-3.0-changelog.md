Release 3.0 is a stable version with major changes on the core & bindings.

<br>

#### API changes

- New API **cs_disasm_iter** & **cs_malloc**. See online doc at [http://capstone-engine.org/iteration.html](http://capstone-engine.org/iteration.html)
- Renamed API *cs_disasm_ex* to **cs_disasm** (*cs_disasm_ex* is still supported, but marked obsolete to be removed in future)
- Support [SKIPDATA mode](http://capstone-engine.org/skipdata.html), so Capstone can jump over unknown data and keep going from the next legitimate instruction.
- More details provided in *cs_detail* struct for all architectures.
- API version was bumped to *3.0*.

<br>

#### Bindings support

- Python binding supports *Python3* (besides Python2).
- Support [Ocaml binding](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/bindings/ocaml/README).

<br>

#### Architectures

- New architectures: *Sparc*, *SystemZ* & *XCore*.
- Important bugfixes for *Arm*, *Arm64*, *Mips*, *PowerPC* & *X86*.
- Support more instructions for *Arm*, *Arm64*, *Mips*, *PowerPC* & *X86*.
- Always expose absolute addresses rather than relative addresses (*Arm*, *Arm64*, *Mips*, *PPC*, *Sparc*, *X86*).
- Use common instruction operand types *REG*, *IMM*, *MEM* & *FP* across all architectures (to enable cross-architecture analysis).
- Use common instruction group types across all architectures (to enable cross-architecture analysis).

<br>

#### X86

- *X86* engine is mature & handles all the *malware tricks* (that we are aware of).
- Added a lot of new instructions (such as *AVX512*, *3DNow*, etc).
- Add prefixed symbols *X86_PREFIX_REP/REPNE/LOCK/CS/DS/SS/FS/GS/ES/OPSIZE/ADDRSIZE* (*x86.h*).
- Print immediate in positive form & hexadecimal for *AND*/*OR*/*XOR* instructions.
- More friendly disassembly for *JMP16i* (in the form *segment*:*offset*)

<br>

#### Mips

- Engine added supports for new hardware modes: *Mips32R6* (*CS_MODE_MIPS32R6) & *MipsGP64* (*CS_MODE_MIPSGP64).
- Removed the ABI-only mode *CS_MODE_N64*.
- New modes **CS_MODE_MIPS32** & **CS_MODE_MIPS64** (instead of *CS_MODE_32* & *CS_MODE_64*).


<br>

#### ARM

- Support new mode *CS_MODE_V8* for *Armv8 A32* encodings.
- Print immediate in positive form & hexadecimal for *AND/ORR/EOR/BIC* instructions

<br>

#### ARM64
- Print immediate in hexadecimal for *AND/ORR/EOR/TST* instructions.

<br>

#### PowerPC

- Do not print a dot in front of absolute address.


<br>

#### Others

- Support for [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/COMPILE_MSVC.TXT) (so Windows native compilation using *MSVC* is possible).

- Support [CMake compilation](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/COMPILE_CMAKE.TXT).

- Cross-compile for *Android*.

- Build libraries/tests using [XCode project](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/xcode/README.md)

- Much faster, while consuming less memory for all architectures.
