Release 2.1.2 is a stable version with some minor bugfixes and improvements in the core.

#### Core changes

- Support cross-compilation for all iDevices (iPhone/iPad/iPod).

- X86: do not print memory offset in negative form.

- Fix a bug in X86 when Capstone cannot handle short instruction.

- Print negative numbers in range \[-9, -1\] without prefix 0x (arm64, mips, arm).

- Correct the SONAME setup for library versioning on Linux, \*BSD & Solaris.

- Set library versioning for dylib of OSX.

- Remove the redundant *include/diet.h*

#### NOTE

- This release fixes the library versioning for Mac OSX, Linux, \*BSD & Solaris. This might require recompiling tools compiled with prior Capstone - but there is no need to modify tools' source whatsoever.

- This version made no API change, so old bindings of release 2.1 still work just fine. The only exception is Python binding package for Windows in [Download](download.html) section: users still need to upgrade this since this package actually includes the new core engine 2.1.2 inside.
