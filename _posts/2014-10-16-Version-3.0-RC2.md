We are glad to announce the **Release Candidate 2** of version **3.0** of Capstone disassembly framework!

The source code is available in [zip](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0-rc2.zip) and [tar.gz](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0-rc2.tar.gz) formats, or at tagname [3.0-rc2](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/releases/tag/3.0-rc2) in our Github repo.

Please test and feed back via our [contact](contact.html).

**NOTE**

- Do use the bindings come with this version, as all the old bindings from version *2.x* are *incompatible and cannot be run with the 3.0 core*.

  For Java/Ocaml/Python bindings, see respective *README* files under *bindings/* directory in the source on how to do fresh-install.

Summary of the important changes of version *3.0-RC2* since *3.0-RC1*:

- New APIs: **cs_disasm_iter** & **cs_malloc**. See documentation at [http://capstone-engine.org/iteration.html](http://capstone-engine.org/iteration.html)

- Some optimizations to improve performance of *cs_disasm*, especially for *Windows* platform.

- Properly handle *cs_disasm* when *count* is in range [2, 32].

- Build libraries/tests using [XCode project](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/next/xcode/README.md)

- *Ocaml binding*: major update on interface & some important fixes.

- *ARM*: add a new field *subtracted* to *cs_arm_op* struct.

- *Mips*

    - Remove the ABI-only mode *CS_MODE_N64*.

    - Get rid of *MIPS_REG_PC* register.

- *PPC*

    - Do not add *CR0* to the operand list as it's not displayed by the disassembly.

    - Print *absolute address* rather than relative address for some relative branch instructions.

- *X86*: properly calculate absolute addresses for relative CALL & JMP - for AT&T syntax.
