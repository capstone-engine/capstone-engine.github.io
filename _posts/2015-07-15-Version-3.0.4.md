We are excited to announce the stable version **3.0.4** of Capstone disassembly framework!

This release fixes some *important security issues*, so all users are *strongly recommended to uprade*.

The source code is available in [zip](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0.4.zip) and [tar.gz](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/3.0.4.tar.gz) formats, or at tagname [3.0.4](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/releases/tag/3.0.4) in our Github repo.

Find pre-compiled binaries in the [Download section](http://capstone-engine.org/download.html).

For any issues, please feed back via our [contact](contact.html).

**NOTE**

- Do use the Python bindings come with this version, as we fixed some issues of version *3.0.3*.

  See file *bindings/python/README* in the source on how to do fresh-install.

- Our Python package [capstone](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/capstone) on *PyPi* can build & install the *core* at the time of installing Python module,
  so the external dependency on the core is eliminated.
  
  Windows users can either instal Python binding of Capstone from [Windows installer](http://capstone-engine.org/download.html), or using our PyPi package [capstone-windows](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/capstone-windows). Note that this already includes the *prebuilt* libraries (for both *Win32* & *Win64* editions) inside, so there is no need to install the core separately.
