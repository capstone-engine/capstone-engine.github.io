We are happy to announce version **2.0** of Capstone disassembly framework!

The source code & precompiled binaries are in the [download](download.html) section. See [documentation](documentation.html) for how to compile and install Capstone.

Version 2.0 brings a lot of important changes:

- Library size is around 50% smaller.

- Much less memory usage.

- Framework is way faster. Especially, the Python binding is 3 ~ 4 times faster than in 1.0.

- New architecture added: PowerPC

- Architectures updated with new instructions & hardware modes for Arm, Arm64 & Mips.

- Flexibility of [choosing which architectures to be compiled in](compile.html), so you can tailor library to your need.

- Support for embedding Capstone into special environments such as kernel or firmware.

- Some critical bug fixes.

**NOTE**

- Version *1.0* is now considered *obsolete* and we *no longer support* it.

- Version 2.0 made few [API changes](changelog.html), so some (trivial) modifications to 1.0-based tools are needed to [switch to 2.0](version_2.0_API.html).
