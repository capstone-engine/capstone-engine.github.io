We are super excited to announce version **4.0** of Capstone disassembler framework!

Exactly 5 years ago, on *December 18th of 2013*, we published our [first version](http://www.capstone-engine.org/Version-1.0). Today, this release 4.0 marks *5 years* of the project! Such a long journey, which is impossible without huge community support!

In no particular order, we would like to thank [Thinkst Canary](https://canary.tools), [NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com), [ECQ](https://e-cq.net), [Senrio](https://senr.io), [GracefulBits](https://gracefulbits.com/) & [Catena Cyber](https://catenacyber.fr) for sponsoring this release!

We also wish to express our sincere gratitude to all [contributors](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/graphs/contributors) & [donators](donate), who generously supported
us to maintain Capstone!

This version improves a lot of things over v3.0.5. The source code is available in [zip](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/4.0.zip) & [tar.gz](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/archive/4.0.tar.gz) formats, or at tag-name [4.0](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/releases/tag/4.0) in our Github repo.
